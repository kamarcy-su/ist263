        <h1>Katelyn Marcy</h1>
        <p>I am a freshman studying Information Management and Technology at Syracuse University. I have an interest in web development, as well as communications. I am hoping to minor in communications at the S.I. Newhouse School of Communications. </p>
        <p>I grew up in a rural town in Syracuse, New York. In my free time, I enjoy drawing, painting, and working on digital art projects. I also enjoy going to the gym, staying active, hiking, and being outside. I spend time working at The Daily Orange as a design editor, where I work on displaying the pages. </p>
